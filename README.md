# Schrödinger’s Cat May Be Dead All Along
Abstract: By framing the problem of determining the state of Schrodinger’s cat as a problem of searching for Hidden Markov Model (HMM), this work shows that Schrodinger’s cat is dead with stationary probabilities P(Cat = Dead) = 1 and P(Cat = Alive) = 0 consistently in various observation-based modelling of the HMM.
