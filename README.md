# Schrödinger’s Cat May Be Dead All Along
Abstract: By framing the problem of determining the state of Schrodinger’s cat as a problem of searching for Hidden Markov Model (HMM), this work shows that there is a high chance that Schrodinger’s cat is dead with a stationary probabilities P(Cat = Dead) = 1, and P(Cat = Alive) = 0.
